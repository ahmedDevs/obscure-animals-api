# obscure-animals-api
An API for obscure animals. This API returns objects with animal species that are little known.



# How It's Made:

**Tech Used:** Node.js, Express, JavaScript, CSS, HTML

I've always enjoyed making software, and I've always been intrigued by animals. Combining these interests to make something devleopers can use is a worthy endeavour.




## Optimizations

Made some changes to facilitate API access and usage.

## Lessons Learned:

Building an API presents some several challenges, one of these challenges is gathering data in an ethical and legal manner. The time I spent dealing with the data aspect of this project has given me a new outlook on data and how to manage it.
